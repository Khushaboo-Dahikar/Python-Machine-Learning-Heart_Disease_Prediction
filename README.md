## Heart Disease Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

### Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model that can identify the presence of heart disease based on various clinical attributes.
By using supervised machine learning algorithms, the model provides a reliable tool for assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making.
The project involves predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients, comparing the performance of multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random 
Forest, Decision Tree), and improving model accuracy through data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and validation techniques like cross-validation.

### Machine Learning Models Used

    1. Logistic Regression
    2. Random Forest
    3. Decision Tree
    
  Among these, the best-performing model achieved:
      
    Accuracy: 87%
    Cross-Validation Accuracy: 82% (average)
    AUC Score: 0.87

### Technologies & Libraries
    
    Python
    Pandas – for data manipulation
    Seaborn & Matplotlib – for data visualization
    Scikit-learn – for building and evaluating ML models

### Data Preprocessing

Steps included:

    Handling missing values
    Feature encoding (categorical to numeric)
    Feature scaling / normalization
    Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
    Cross-validation for reliable model evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics
    Accuracy
    AUC-ROC Curve
    Confusion Matrix
    Cross-Validation Score
    
### Results
The Random Forest classifier provided the best results with 87% accuracy and an AUC score of 0.87. 
Cross-validation helped ensure the model's generalizability with an average performance of 82%.
